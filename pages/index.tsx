              Hi there ðŸ‘‹ <br />I am a Front-End Developer with hands-on to
              build user-friendly and professional looking sites. I have
              knowledge to solve a problem across many mediums and especially
              adept at taking an already existed project to the next level. With
              every project I aim to make the user experience intuitive and easy
              to follow for any level of user. I look forward to using my skills
              as a developer and designer as part of a quality-driven team to
              build easy-to-use and professional looking sites.
            </p>

          Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineer with hands-on to build
          user-friendly and professional looking sites. I have knowledge to
          solve a problem across many mediums and especially adept at taking an
          already existed project to the next level. With every project I aim to
          make the user experience intuitive and easy to follow for any level of
          user. I look forward to using my skills as a developer and designer as
          part of a quality-driven team to build easy-to-use and professional
          looking sites.
